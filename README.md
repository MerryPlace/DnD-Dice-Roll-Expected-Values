# DnD-Dice-Roll-Expected-Values
Tool for comparing the average value of dice rolls, including rolls with advantage and disadvantage. 

An expected value is the average result of a random variable's probability distribution. In this case, the dice rolls in d&d have comparable values so the expected value is a meaningful way of deciding which dice roll is superior. This tool was made with 5th edition d&d in mind so you can roll with advantage (roll twice, keep the highest) or disadvantage (roll twice, keep the lowest) allowing you to compare any type of roll. Feel free to leave suggestions on how I could improve this tool.
