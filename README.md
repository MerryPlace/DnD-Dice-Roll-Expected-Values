# DnD-Dice-Roll-Expected-Values
Tool for comparing the average value of uniquely sided dice rolls, including rolls with advantage and disadvantage. 


In statistics, the expected value is the average result of a random variable's probability distribution. Expected value is a meaningful way of deciding which type of DnD dice roll is superior. Normal dice rolls are cumulative but with advantage rolls you take the highest value and discard the others. 
The roll format of "**x**d**n**" describes **x** rolls of a dice that has **n** sides. 
Add a plus or minus to the front of the roll to designate it as an advantage or disadvantage roll.
Enter the letter **'h'** to get help with formatting and enter **'q'** to quit the program.
